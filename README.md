# Realms of Despair Client

Welcome! This is a small, friendly desktop app for playing the Realms of Despair (RoD) MUD. It focuses on being easy, fast, and comfy—so you can jump in and have fun.

## What Is It?
- A clean text window with a big Connect button and a few handy controls made for RoD.
- Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. No setup or accounts—just open it and go.

## Highlights
- Easy connect: enter host and port, then click Connect.
- Colorful text and common formatting are displayed nicely.
- Direction pad for one‑click movement (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, Up, Down).
- Shortcut buttons (macros): 10 buttons you can name and edit for your favorite commands.
- Echo toggle: choose whether to see what you type.
- Simple text actions: copy, select all, and clear.

## Quick Start
- Windows
  - Double‑click `dist/RealmsClient.exe` (if included).
  - Prefer to run from source? See macOS/Linux steps below.
- macOS & Linux
  - Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed.
  - Run: `python3 modern_realms_client.py`

## Connect to Realms of Despair
- Host: `realmsofdespair.com`
- Port: `4000`
- Click `Connect`, type in the box at the bottom, and press Enter to send.
- Tip: Right‑click a shortcut (macro) button to edit and save it for later.

## Handy Tips
- The app remembers your macro edits next to the program, so they’re there next time.
- The text input keeps focus so you can just type—no extra clicks.

## Old App Note
There’s an older Windows program saved in `legacy_app/` for historical reasons. The modern client in this folder is the recommended one.
